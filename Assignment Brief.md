#Assignment brief
#================

#Initial pass criteria
#SNAP card game. Create a 2-player game where a a deck of 52 cards is divided into 2 sets of 26, 1 set per player.
#When each player presses their "deal" key, the card on the top of their deck is played.
#If the current card's "face value" - i.e jack or king or 2 - matches the previous card face value, then the first player to press their "SNAP" key wins the round.

#The cards are then re-allocated and another round begins.

#After 5 rounds, the overall winner is declared (printed to screen)
