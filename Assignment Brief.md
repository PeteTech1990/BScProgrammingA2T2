#Assignment brief
#================

#Initial pass criteria
#Create a commercial app that allows users to make bookings at a theme park. Users must be able to select an item category ("Forest Coaster", "Bounce Below", "Velocity 2", "Beverages", "Food") and then select a number of items within that category (e.g 1 adult for forest coaster, 1 child for bounce below, 2 hot drinks and a sandwich). Users should also be able to select an applicable discount type (10% locals, 12.5% membership card). After the user has finished selecting their items, program should also ask "are you ready to print your ticket?". If so, the program will print a basic list of their requested items (organised by category), plus a unique SEQUENTIAL serial number and the total cost of their bookings. The program should not quit unless the user selects "quit".
